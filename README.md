## My Portfolio Page

This is the repo to my front-end to my portfolio site. I still have a lot to do BUT, it is up and running on : www.shebsaund.co.uk (I know right? How cool...I have my own website! I MADE IT MOM!). I used AWS Amplify to deploy it on the world-wide web. My next stage is to make it responsive and build a backend where my projects can be displayed. 

-  30/03/2022 So, the time has come for me to finally develop my portfolio page. I am using Next.js and will aim to deploy it using AWS amplify. Wish me luck!
